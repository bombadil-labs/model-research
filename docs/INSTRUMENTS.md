# Broken instruments: what this project measured wrong, how it found out, and what it now checks

**Seven** instruments are logged here as broken: §1, §2, §3, §4, §4b, §6 and §7. §5 holds two failures of
the same family that were **not** instrument failures — a sound measurement on an unsound stimulus,
and a calibration that failed its own band — and is not counted. Anything that cites a different
number is counting headings. (A seventh, the post-norm residual found at hour 40, is recorded in
`src/lsx/core/rediscovery.py` and `research/narrative/notes/core_p1.md` and has never been written
up here.)

Over 38 logged stages (`RESULTS.md`) this project found four of its own measurement instruments
broken: two on the first day (hours 3 and 6), two on the second (hours 32 and 36), plus a failed
calibration on the second day (hour 38). A sixth followed at hour 55 on the shame-axis line. Each had already produced numbers that were read as
findings; each discovery withdrew or qualified them. A reader deciding whether to trust the repo's
positive results should see this record first: it shows what kind of error this pipeline produces,
how long each survived, and which standing results rest on checks that have never been run. Every
number is quoted from `RESULTS.md` or the named note; where the record is silent, that is stated.

## 1. A cross-talk rank pinned at chance by construction (hour 6)

**What it was.** Test C in `scripts/narrative/stage5_factors.py`: under an era patch, rank each of the three
voice variants among the three by absolute log-probability, era fixed, against the unpatched
ranking; likewise era under a voice patch.

**What it appeared to show.** In `research/narrative/results/stage5_qwen1.5b_factors_l14.json`, both
`C_voice_under_era` and `C_era_under_voice` average exactly 2.0 patched and 2.0 unpatched over 108
rows each. Read naively: the era patch leaves the voice ordering undisturbed; the factors are
orthogonal. That is the result the hypothesis wanted.

**What it actually was.** Ranking each of three candidates among the same three yields a
permutation of {1, 2, 3} for any log-probability vector; the mean is 2 whatever the patch did.

**How it was caught.** By reading the metric's definition at write-up time: hour 6 records
"averages to exactly 2 by construction, so the 'readout under patch' numbers in the log are
meaningless." No control caught it; the base rank was sitting at 2.0 in the log unread.

**What it invalidated.** Nothing published: the metric was replaced before its numbers were quoted
(commit `cf8d821`). The replacement is a variance decomposition of the 3×3 gain matrix under a
single-factor patch: era 0.59 on-target / 0.14 other / 0.27 residual; voice 0.65 / 0.17 / 0.18;
random direction 0.27 / 0.23 / 0.50.

**Standing check.** Cross-talk is reported only beside its random-direction row, which fixes what an
uninformative patch looks like. Since hour 36 a uniform cross-talk matrix is read as a fingerprint of
degenerate gains, not a finding about factors (§4).

## 2. Best-layer selection on held-out data (hours 1–3)

**What it was.** Stage 3 fit a role-to-role transfer on seven domains and scored the eighth by
`role_rank` (chance 3.5), reporting both the all-layers mean and "each pair's best layer".

**What it appeared to show.** Shared-offset transfer 2.35 over all layers and 2.01 at the best
layer; affine 3.03 and 2.45. Hour 2 called the column "optimistic" but kept reporting it.

**What it actually was.** Selecting the best of 29 layers on the same held-out data that scores it.
Hour 3 pushed a constant predictor (the mean target, no source information) through the same
selection: **3.5 → 2.4 by selection alone.**

**How it was caught.** By a baseline. The same hour found the constant mean-target baseline scored
1.07 on its own at 42 training examples, so every stage-3 number before hour 3 was a role-identity
signature plus position, not a source-to-target relation.

**What it invalidated.** All best-layer numbers from hours 1–2 and, with the constant-baseline
finding, all pre-hour-3 relation claims. The relation survived only after role-centering (3.01 vs
null 3.48–3.54, hour 3) and at forty domains (2.21, hour 16 — that figure is the step-4 subsample;
the full step-2 curve mean is 2.1692, hour 47).

**Standing check.** "Best-layer numbers are dropped from here on" (hour 3); `WRITEUP.md` states
they are never reported. Later sweeps report the full curve with a per-layer null (hour 5; hour 38
at all 29 layers with permutation z at each). Caveat: hour 38 still evaluates S2 and S4 at
`L* = argmax_L G_res,A(L)` over the scoring data; pre-registered, but still selection on held-out.

## 3. A residual norm at its own noise floor (hours 28, 30, 31; caught at 32)

**What it was.** The subject-clock probe of `docs/specs/time_translation_v1.md`:
resid(s, Δt) = d(s, Δt) − mean_s d(s, Δt), with d built from three-paraphrase means of a
1536-dimensional mean-pooled state span; τ(s) = first Δt at which ‖resid‖ reaches half its maximum.

**What it appeared to show.** τ = 1 day for every subject at every layer (hour 28, v1 grid);
unchanged on the vocabulary-matched v2 grid (hour 30); 0 of 8 subjects with τ > 1 day on
Gemma-2-9B-it at layers 9/20/31 (hour 31). Three published negatives across two models:
"subject-relative timescales do not appear", "remain absent", "still absent".

**What it actually was.** Spec `docs/specs/subject_clocks_v1.md` §0, written by the planner before
any run: if paraphrases within a cell scatter with per-dimension SD σ, the difference of two
three-paraphrase means has expected norm ≈ σ·√(2d/3) ≈ 32σ at d = 1536, whether or not the described
state changed. The v2 residuals ran 7–11 at layer 14 for every subject and Δt against ‖d‖ 12–16:
the signature of a floor. A one-dimensional projection has floor σ·√(2/3) ≈ 0.8σ, ~40× better
signal-to-noise from the same data. And half-max on a flat noisy curve fires on the first point, so
τ = 1 day was the guaranteed output. Hour 32 confirmed it: floor F = 7.2 at layer 14,
residual-to-floor ratio 1.12 at 1 day and 1.39 at 1 My, 7 of 8 subjects inside 0.8–1.3 for every
Δt ≤ 1 y at four of five layers, nothing above 1.8×. **The same pipeline run end to end on Gaussian
noise returns ratios averaging 0.95 and "no signal" everywhere**: the earlier curves are
indistinguishable from noise.

**How it was caught.** By arithmetic before running anything, then confirmed by the noise run.

**What it invalidated.** The three negatives of hours 28, 30 and 31, withdrawn as untested. The
replacement probe (floor-referenced 1-D readout, SNR 5.3–7.2) found a determinate τ for 7 of 7
changing subjects but no subject ordering (1 of 9 predicted pairs), and that result is itself
lexically confounded (§5).

**Standing check.** Every residual is reported beside its noise floor; the estimator is run on
synthetic noise before real data (hour 32; hour 38 §2.1 self-test with pure-noise features,
ρ = −0.059 against null +0.008 ± 0.065); knees are replaced by floor-referenced thresholds.

## 4. A remote patching harness that wrote into batch row zero (hour 34; caught at 36)

**What it was.** `scripts/narrative/ndif_factors.py`, the NDIF selector battery, patched with
`B[l].output[0][:] = B[l].output[0] + v` and ranked with `rank = 1 + #{gain[c] > gain[target]}`.

**What it appeared to show.** Hour 34, spec `docs/specs/scale_vs_tuning_v1.md`: theme lens rank
1.22 / 1.11 / 1.06 of 3 on Llama-3.1-8B / 70B / 70B-Instruct, far under chance 2.0, but the
random-direction control at 1.14–1.28 on all three. Logged as an unresolved blocker in the same
entry.

**What it actually was** (`research/narrative/notes/random_control_diagnosis.md`). Under transformers ≥ 4.54 a
Llama, Gemma or Qwen decoder layer returns a bare tensor `[batch, seq, d]`, so `output[0]` is batch
row 0, not the hidden states. Hour 34 ran with `NDIF_CHUNK=9`, all nine candidates in one padded
batch, so every patch, factor and random alike, touched one text and left eight identical to base.
The rank formula scores a tie as rank 1, so the target scores 3 only when it is the moved text, 1
row in 9: expected rank **11/9 = 1.22 for any direction whatsoever**, and (8·1 + 9)/9 = 1.89 for the
composed test (observed 1.81). Fingerprint: all 48 cross-talk rows in each hour-34 file read
0.25/0.25 to seven decimals, where hour 13's Gemma file ranges 0.007–0.846. Confirmed on 8B with
three texts in one batch: as-shipped gains [−7.47, 0, 0]; whole-tensor patch [−7.47, −2.23, −6.79];
output shape [3, 18, 4096]. Reproduced locally on Qwen2.5-1.5B: row-0 patching gives random
1.31/1.14. A third bug: left padding under a mask that assumed right padding.

**How it was caught.** Only because the random control came out equal to its treatment. **The
no-patch baseline that would have caught it instantly had never been run**: under the shipped rank
it scores 1.00 (doing nothing looks like a perfect selector), under mid-rank ties 2.00. The
treatment number was not alarming on its own: 1.22 is both the artifact's fixed point and the true
8B era rank after the fix.

**What it invalidated.** All five hour-34 selector files, three cross-talk matrices, the "random
control collapses on every Llama" finding, and the layer-sweep conclusion, so hour 33's depth
confound is reopened. Standing: decodability 0.89/0.89/0.92 (no patching), the 405B no-go, hour 13
(GPT-J returns a tuple; Gemma ran at batch 1), all local batteries, and all generation-level NDIF
results, which trace one prompt per job and are correct by accident. Corrected 8B at layer 10: era
1.22, theme 1.33, random 2.11, no-patch 2.00, composed 2.03 of 9.

**Standing check.** Commit `fe31abb`: a tuple-or-tensor `resid()` helper, mid-rank ties, a
mandatory no-patch arm, right padding. Hour 37 added an assertion that fails if at most one
candidate's score moved; no-patch read exactly 2.00 in all four hour-37 runs. Fixed at hour 39: the six other NDIF
scripts (`ndif_generate`, `ndif_shift`, `ndif_commutator`, `ndif_recompose_gen`,
`ndif_recompose_sweep`, `ndif_absential_probe`) kept the `output[0][:]` idiom, which the note called
"a live trap"; each was verified to run at batch 1 (so no logged number moves) and all now use the
`resid()` helper. The local selector scripts (`stage5_factors.py`, `stage6_factors.py`,
`time_translation_selector.py`) ranked 1-on-ties with no no-patch arm; both are fixed
(`research/narrative/notes/instrument_audit.md`).

## 4b. A batched extraction that read its spans out of the padding (hours 30–31; caught at 39)

**What it was.** `scripts/narrative/ndif_time_translation_extract.py`, the Gemma-2-9B-it time-grid extractor,
batches six passages per NDIF job through six `tracer.invoke` blocks and pools the interval and state
spans by **absolute** token index from `B[bi].output[0]`.

**What it appeared to show.** Hour 31: the shared clock replicates on Gemma-9B — shared variance
fraction 0.478, Spearman(‖shared‖, log Δt) 0.683, adjacent/distant cosine 0.87/0.61 — i.e. the clock
is model-invariant across a 6× parameter jump.

**What it actually was.** Not the hour-36 bug: nnsight 0.7's `Batcher.narrow` slices the batch
dimension per invoke, so inside invoke *i* the block output is that passage's row alone and
`output[0]` is safe (confirmed on NDIF: last-token vectors match a batch-of-one extraction to cosine
0.99996). But `LanguageModel` loads its tokenizer with `padding_side="left"` and pads the six texts
to a common length, and `narrow` touches only the batch dimension — so the sequence dimension keeps
the padding while the indices were computed on the unpadded text. Every passage shorter than the
longest of its six had its spans read `n_pad` positions too early. Measured on the v2 grid: **363 of
480 passages corrupted**, 232 of them with the *entire* interval span inside the padding block; the
batched-vs-single cosine for a 30-token-padded passage is 0.287 (interval) and 0.794 (state) against
0.999997 / 0.999991 for the unpadded one. Because jobs are consecutive grid items, the shift is
correlated with Δt — the measurement's own axis.

**How it was caught.** By running the missing arm: the same three passages extracted batched and one
per job, with a position-stable last-token readout alongside the span readouts to separate "wrong
row" from "wrong positions". Three NDIF jobs, 18 seconds.

**What it invalidated.** Every number in hour 31's shared-clock replication, withdrawn (its
subject-clock half was already withdrawn at hour 32). The grid was re-extracted with the fixed
script and the measurements redone: shared variance fraction 0.478 → **0.501**, Spearman 0.683 →
**0.767**, adjacent/distant cosine 0.87/0.61 → **0.89/0.57**, phrase-only ratio 1.67 → **2.50** at
layer 20 (and 1.72 → 3.31 at layer 31, the largest move, in the measure that reads the interval span
that was being pooled out of the padding). The *conclusion* survives on the corrected vectors — the
clock does replicate on Gemma-9B — but on new numbers, and still inside the v2 grid's lexical
confound. See `research/narrative/notes/instrument_audit.md`.

**Standing check.** Span indices are counted from the end of the sequence (correct under left
padding, identical at batch 1) with an assertion on `tokenizer.padding_side`. The sibling batched
readers `ndif_recompose_gen`/`ndif_recompose_sweep` pool `[..., -k:, :]` and were immune for that
reason — stated in the code now rather than left to luck.

## 5. Same family, not broken instruments: the lexical floor and a failed calibration

**Lexical floor (hours 32, 35, 38).** The measurement was sound and the stimulus was not. Hour 32
found Δt-discrimination of 1.00 at layer 0, before any computation, because the v2 state texts
restate the interval ("One day later the mayfly is dead"); the leak check flags 221 of 240 v2 state
spans. Hour 35's v3 grid (0 of 240 flagged) kept the clock (variance share 0.507, cosine 0.94–0.95
to the v2 direction) but layer-0 discrimination fell only to 0.72: far-interval prose uses a
different register from near-interval prose. Hour 38 quantified the copying: with the interval
phrase removed, hour 35's layer-14 discrimination of **0.961 falls to 0.522** under the same
centroid readout (0.890 → 0.812 under ridge). The clock was re-posed as gain over a lexical floor
(ρ_lex = 0.728) and closed as a computed register detector, not a clock.

**Calibration failure (hour 38).** Spec `docs/specs/clock_depth_gain_v1.md` §3.4.6 required its
primary statistic to read G_res(0) ∈ [−0.05, +0.05], because layer 0 is the floor's own input
(verified: cosine 0.999999999 to the static-embedding bag). Observed −0.323 / −0.321 / −0.314 on
three arms, permutation null −0.586 at layer 0: residualising then refitting over-subtracts when the
two readouts' errors correlate. P0 was graded failed, G_res reported in full (peak 0.297 at layer
24, z = 7.6), and an unbiased rank-partial companion put beside it (null mean ≤ 0.013 at every
layer; peak 0.566 at layer 13). The companion's layer-0 values, +0.066 / −0.047 / +0.074, sit
marginally outside the band on two of three arms.

## 6. A calibration gate built only from null arms (hour 55)

`research/shame-axis/notes/behavioural_prereg.md` froze a phrase-list coder for the behavioural
conscription arms and declared its calibration in advance: two arms contain no false claim, so a
working coder must read ≈ 0 correction on both. *"If either calibration arm reads high, the coder
is broken and no other number in this experiment means anything."*

Both read **0.000**. So did all five other arms. Zero corrections in 168 continuations.

**A gate assembled only from nulls has no branch for the case where everything reads low
together.** An arm containing no false claim reads ≈ 0 under a working coder *and* under a coder
with no sensitivity at all; the two are indistinguishable by that test, and the pre-registration
called the indistinguishable case a pass. The coder had passed 5/5 hand-written probes before the
run, which shows it can fire on constructed text and says nothing about whether it fires on this
model's prose.

The gate was also load-bearing for a kill condition: prediction 4 said that if the design arms are
corrected at similar rates, the manipulation never landed and the design needs restructuring. That
condition read TRIGGERED — off a measurement that cannot tell "no difference" from "no
sensitivity". It was not evidence for restructuring and has not been acted on.

**What it invalidated.** Nothing that had been believed; the failure was caught on the run's first
reading, because zero in all seven cells is a fixed point of the same kind as §1's 2.0 and §3's
τ = 1 day. `exit-escalation` stayed `running` rather than being graded from it.

**The missing arm, in this instrument's terms.** Every other section here wanted the treatment
*removed* — a constant predictor, a random direction, no patch. A coder wants the opposite: an arm
where the thing being counted is **known to be present**, so a reading of zero is a refutation of
the instrument rather than a result. Null arms bound false positives. Only a positive control
bounds false negatives, and a rate of zero is all false negatives or all true ones.

## 7. The opener readout: a doubled `<bos>` and logits read before the softcap (hours 55–62; caught at 62b)

`asserted_remote_patched_logprob` — the teacher-forced readout under hour 56's opener statistic —
and `asserted_remote_generate` had two faults, both found by the agent implementing hour 62b, both
verified by hand before this was written.

**A doubled `<bos>`.** Every behavioural stimulus is rendered through Gemma-2's chat template,
whose text already begins with `<bos>`. `_encode` tokenises with `add_special_tokens=True`, which
prepends a second: the model saw `[2, 2, 106, …]` on every prompt. This is the hazard hour 50's
replication found and fixed in `painaxis_remote` — "every shape check and §7 assertion passes
under that bug" — and the fix never reached the readout or the generation path. The scorers'
own guard counted `<bos>` with `add_special_tokens=False`, which is not how the text was encoded,
so it passed. Measured effect on `ritual` on 60 items: mean −0.64, mean |·| 1.05, max 2.80.

**Logits read before the softcap, reduced in bf16.** The readout reads `lm_head.output`. Gemma-2
applies `final_logit_softcapping` (30·tanh(z/30)) *after* that module, so every log-prob was
computed on logits the model never samples from, and `logsumexp` ran in bf16: 92% of no-patch
log-probs are multiples of 1/32, and one six-token opener scores log p = 0.0 exactly on 11.7% of
items. The agent measured the consequence directly: scoring the same prompt with the openers
batched 3 instead of 6 moves `ritual` by 0.18 on average — the size of every steering effect in
62b. Hour 56's "chunking is exact" test passed on the local twin, which runs fp32 and has no
softcap; the remote readout was never exact.

**What it invalidated, pending re-scoring:** every behavioural number on the conscription line —
hour 55's greedy replies (doubled `<bos>` only), hours 56, 59, 59b and 62a (both faults), 62b
(softcap and precision; its `<bos>` was stripped by the agent). The activation work is clean:
hours 54, 57, 58a, 58b and 61 extracted through `painaxis_remote` with `add_special_tokens=False`.
Claims that rest on the affected hours are set to `running` until re-scored.

**The missing arm, in this instrument's terms:** a readout of the model's *output* should be
checked against the model's output — `model.output.logits`, not an intermediate module — and a
batching-invariance test must run on the instrument that produces the numbers, not on its twin.

## What the seven have in common

Two claims were put to the record; the first holds, the second does not, and a third emerges.

*Every instrument produced a plausible number.* Confirmed, and stronger: each failure mode was a
fixed point that coincided with a meaningful reading. 2.0 read as orthogonality; 2.01 as transfer;
τ = 1 day as "no subject clock"; 1.22 as a sharp lens, and it was the true value.

*Three of four were caught by a control or baseline.* Not confirmed as put, and the arithmetic
moved when §4b joined. Three were caught by a control: best-layer (a constant predictor through the
same selection), batch-row (a random direction equal to treatment), and the padded spans (batched
against one-per-job, three NDIF jobs, eighteen seconds). The noise floor was caught by arithmetic
before running. The cross-talk rank was caught by reading its definition; its base rank was already
2.0 in the log and was not read as a tell. **Count: three by control, three by reasoning about
construction.**

*The missing arm was always the same arm.* The check that would have caught each one immediately
measures the instrument with the treatment removed: a constant predictor, Gaussian noise, no patch.
Each was run only after the fact. The noise floor survived three hours, two models and a vocabulary
rewrite; the batch-row bug would have survived indefinitely had the control not failed; the padded
spans survived two hours and a cross-model replication, and fell in eighteen seconds once the arm
was run.

## What currently rests on instruments that have never been independently checked

- **No local selector battery has a no-patch arm** (hours 4–11, 23, 28–32), and their scripts ranked
  1-on-ties. Both properties are fixed at hour 39 (mid-rank ties + a zero-direction arm in
  `stage5_factors`, `stage6_factors`, `time_translation_selector`). Hour 8's three-factor battery was
  re-run with both fixes: every number reproduces to two decimals (era 1.25, voice 1.24, tense 1.03,
  composed 2.81 of 18, same cross-talk matrix) and **the no-patch arm reads exactly chance on all
  four tests** (2.00 / 2.00 / 1.50 / 9.50). Ties never fired locally — one text per forward pass
  gives distinct gains — so no logged local number changes, and the batteries now have the positive
  control they lacked. Hour 8's low tense random control (1.44) sits beside a no-patch of exactly
  1.50, so it is a fluctuation, not an instrument failure. See `research/narrative/notes/instrument_audit.md`. Their defence is a random control at chance (1.83–2.25). Hour 8's tense control is
  the exception: factor 1.03 of 2, random 1.44 against chance 1.5, flagged at hour 36, not re-run.
- **Every generation-level NDIF result** (hours 12–14, 19, 22, 27, 29, 31, 33) and hour 13's Gemma
  battery use the batch-row idiom at batch 1 with no plumbing assertion. Hour 29's dose-response
  (0.27 → 0.84 across 1×–3×) is the only evidence those patches land.
- ~~**Hour 31's Gemma extraction** batches six passages per job through `tracer.invoke` with
  `output[0]`.~~ Checked at hour 39 (§4b): `tracer.invoke` scoping makes `output[0]` safe, but the
  absolute span indices were read out of nnsight's **left padding** for 363 of 480 passages. Hour 31
  is withdrawn; the extractor is fixed and the grid re-extracted.
- **The abstraction ladder** (hours 15, 26) has no permutation null or random-feature control in the
  record. Hour 39 specifies exactly which three nulls it needs (merge-test null against the two
  dictionaries' different marginal generality distributions, a size-matched random-feature control on
  the width effect, and a matched-count + label-permutation null on the flow) and prices them at one
  CPU-only session with no NDIF, since the corpus residuals are cached; the broad corpus already shrank its effect from 2.9× to 1.9×, and the merge test (12 of
  15, 13 of 15) has no null distribution.
- **The shared-clock selector numbers in `WRITEUP.md` claim 10** (3.9 vs 5.7, 3.6 vs 4.8) come from
  the v1/v2 grids in which 221 of 240 state spans restate the interval; never re-run on v3.
- **Hour 38's headline** rests on a companion statistic introduced after the pre-registered one
  failed calibration, evaluated at a layer chosen by argmax on the scoring data.
