"""§1A: the reproduction suite. This is where the core either proves itself or does not.

Each target is a row of spec §1A. A target is graded in one of four ways, and three of them are
results:

  * **reproduced** -- re-derived through the core and inside the per-target tolerance;
  * **REFUSED** -- the core will not publish the number as logged. Two §1A rows are restated in the
    spec precisely because of this, and a refusal here is the acceptance test passing, not failing;
  * **deferred** -- the target's stack is not cached (spec §11.3 says defer rather than re-extract)
    or its statistic has no built instrument (§8's `discrimination`, §11.4's deferrals);
  * **FAILED** -- re-derived and outside tolerance. The rule, pre-registered in §1A: the target is
    then withdrawn from the writeup. The tolerance is not loosened.

Tolerances are per target and measured, never one number for all:

  * local: ±0.02, from §1A (h39's re-run reproduced h8 to two decimals);
  * remote: measured in piece 3 by re-running one remote target twice; see `REMOTE_TOLERANCE`.

Nothing here reads a number out of a logged JSON and calls it reproduced. Where a target is graded
from logged per-item values rather than re-derived, the row says so and the verdict is `deferred`,
not `reproduced`.

    Piece 4 published h8's composed row as `gain_over_floor` with the floor set to the joint
    midpoint 9.50, which is **chance**, and said so in a note: `narrative_factors_v2` is flagged by
    its own leak report, §6 requires gain over the *measured* floor on a flagged grid, and h8 never
    built a lexical predictor over its 18 joint variants. This is that predictor.

    It is built to be the treatment with the activations swapped out and nothing else changed:

      * the direction for a level is the mean bag-of-tokens vector of the training scenes' items at
        that level, minus the training grand mean -- the same arithmetic as `level_directions`, on
        binary token-presence vectors instead of residuals;
      * the composed direction is the sum of the three level directions, as in the treatment;
      * a candidate is scored by cosine against that direction, and the statistic is the same
        `midrank` of the true variant among the same candidate set.

    So a difference between the two is a difference between residuals and word counts, not between
    two ranking procedures. Returns the per-item ranks, which is what a `Floor` on this grid should
    have carried since h8.

    `permute_seed` runs the floor's OWN permutation control: the factor labels are shuffled among
    the training items before the lexical directions are fit. A floor that still scores well under
    it would be measuring the ranking procedure rather than the words -- and a floor that quietly
    reads too low is the most dangerous object in this file, because every gain is computed against

    """h8's permutation arm, pooled over independent draws, with the band measured at the unit the
    randomness actually lives in.

    **This is the h16 lesson arriving on a second target, and it arrived as a refusal.** The arm as
    a single draw reads era 2.139 / voice 2.347 / tense 1.417 against nulls of 2.00 / 2.00 / 1.50,
    and `selector`'s registry band at n = 72 is +-0.289, so the voice lens was refused with
    `ArmOffNull`. The band is 3 sigma on the statistic's per-ITEM null spread over 72 items -- but
    a permutation arm's 72 items are **four draws** (one per scene) times eighteen re-rankings of
    them. n counts repetitions, not evidence, which is exactly what piece 4 found for h16 and wrote
    into that claim's notes.

    So it was measured rather than argued (`h8_permutation_null`, six further independent draws):

    | factor | draw means over 6 fresh draws | sd across draws | registry band at n=72 |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | era   | 1.986 ... 2.375 | 0.172 | 0.289 |
    | voice | 1.403 ... 2.306 | **0.349** | 0.289 |
    | tense | 1.167 ... 1.583 | 0.152 | 0.177 |

    One draw's *one-sigma* spread is larger than the whole three-sigma band the registry computes
    from the item count. The arm was never off its null; it was under-powered, and the band was
    measured at the wrong unit.

    The fix here is more evidence, not a wider band: the arm becomes the **pooled** arm over all
    seven draws, and its tolerance is 3 sigma on the between-DRAW spread of its own means --
    `3 * sd / sqrt(n_draws)`, the cluster-robust form piece 4 used for h16 with the independent
    unit read off the design. Both bands are recorded in the claim, because the point is that the
    i.i.d. one is wrong here and not merely inconvenient.

    Stated plainly because the order of events matters: the refusal fired first and the measurement
    came after it. What the measurement establishes is that a single-draw permutation arm on this
    design has almost no power -- a band of +-1.05 on a rank bounded in [1, 3] would admit an arm
    reading as low as the treatment -- and that is a defect of h8's battery which pooling reduces
    and does not remove. With no `perm_draws` the shipped single draw is used unchanged and the
    registry band applies, which is the conservative path and the one that refuses voice.

    ACCURACY. `top1_accuracy` exists now, so the number can be computed by the core -- and the row

    the instrument:

      * the logged run carries ONE arm. `ndif_recompose_sweep.py` at scale 3.0 emits the `shift`
        condition and nothing else, so there is no random-direction arm and no no-patch arm.
        `CLAUDE.md`'s first non-negotiable -- "every battery reports treatment, random AND
        no-patch" -- is not met by a number that is in `RESULTS.md` today, and `MissingArm` is the
        core saying so without being told to look.
      * the provenance is a frozen script's JSON, not a `Stack`, so `ProvenanceNotFromStack` fires
        at the ledger even if the arms existed.

    The verdict is therefore REFUSED and no longer `deferred (no instrument)`. What changed is
