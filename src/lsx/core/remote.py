"""§7 on the remote path: every NDIF forward, `Probe` included, through one asserted function.

Pieces 1, 2 and 3 each closed with the same sentence in their handover notes: *`Probe` is a shell;
nothing NDIF-side goes through the asserted path.* Spec §7 is explicit that this is where it
matters most -- "the stage-36 bug lived in a patched forward, not in an extraction, so assertions
scoped to `Stack` alone would have missed it" -- and h34, h36, h37 and h39 are all remote. Until
this module existed, the moved-candidates assertion that caught h34 guarded no NDIF call at all.

What is asserted here is what `extract.build_stack` asserts locally, on the same code:

  1. **padding side** read from the remote tokenizer and compared to the indexing convention
     (`checks.assert_padding_convention`). nnsight's `LanguageModel` loads Gemma's tokenizer with
     `padding_side='left'`, which is the h39 trap.
  2. **batched-vs-single equivalence on the SHORTEST item** of each batch
     (`checks.assert_batch_equivalence`), never a random sample -- the shortest item is the
     maximally padded one.
  3. **moved-candidates on every patched forward** (`checks.assert_moved_candidates`): the number
     of sequences whose score changed equals the batch size. This is h34/h36.
  4. **non-empty spans**, never resolving into padding.
  5. **the block output resolved by `checks.resid`**, by type and never by index. `output[0]` is
     batch row 0 whenever a decoder block returns a bare tensor, which Gemma-2 on today's NDIF
     deployment does -- measured, not assumed, in `results/ndif_probe_asserted.json`.
  6. **provenance** carrying the NDIF-reported library versions beside the local ones, and signed
     by `types.stack_signature` exactly as a local stack is, so a remote claim can reach the ledger
     on the same terms as a local one and no others.

nnsight is imported inside the functions: this module must be importable from the py3.11 venv that
runs the test suite, where there is no nnsight, so that `lsx.core` stays one package rather than
two. The tests that need a live deployment are marked and skipped there.

    The **moved-candidates** clause cannot be asserted inside a generation job -- there is no second
    arm inside one forward to compare against -- so it is asserted by the caller in two places
    instead, and neither is optional: `assert_patch_reaches_batch` runs the same patch through the
