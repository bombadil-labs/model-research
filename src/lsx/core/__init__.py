"""`lsx.core`: the verified measurement core (docs/specs/core_v1.md).

Piece 4: `discrimination` and `top1_accuracy`, the asserted REMOTE path (`remote`, and `Probe`
is no longer a shell), a per-item `role_rank` sweep, and three more rediscovery cases.
Piece 3: the ledger, retraction and the §1A reproduction suite.
Piece 1: the rediscovery harness (§1B), the types (§3) and the one asserted extraction path (§7).
Piece 2: the instrument registry (§8), the calibration battery (§5) and the three instruments
`selector`, `composition` and `readout_shift`. Importing this package imports `instruments`, which publishes each built instrument's
calibration key so that `Claim` can refuse a stale measured report.

Existing `scripts/` are frozen and do not use this package (spec §10).

This package is SHARED across research lines. Line-specific modules live in
`lsx.narrative` and `lsx.shame_axis` and must never be imported from here.
