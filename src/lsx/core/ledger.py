"""§9: the ledger and retraction.

A `Claim` is the only exportable type; `results/ledger.jsonl` is the only place a claim becomes a
*result*. This module is therefore the last gate, and it holds the three refusals pieces 1 and 2
each identified and each left open, because each of them is about publication rather than about
whether the arithmetic is right:

1. **A hand-declared calibration report cannot be graded.** Piece 2 stamped
   `CalibrationReport.hand_declared(...)` so it could not pass for a measured one; nothing acted on
   the stamp. Here it is refused. (Piece 1's harness cases 3, 4 and 7 use hand-declared reports on
   purpose -- they are demonstrations that a mechanism fires, not results, and they never reach
   this file.)

2. **A row whose provenance did not come from a real `Stack` cannot be published.** Every §7
   assertion guards `extract.build_stack`; until now nothing tied a `Claim` to it, so a hand-rolled
   extraction could be wrapped in a well-formed `Claim`. `build_stack` now stamps a signature over
   its own provenance fields and the activation digest, and `append` recomputes it. This is not a
   security boundary and is not meant as one: it means an unasserted extraction cannot reach the
   ledger by accident, and cannot reach it at all without someone writing the forgery on purpose.

3. **A swept axis must carry the curve the core computed, not the caller's prose about it.** Piece
   2 built `Instrument.sweep` and explicitly handed this decision to piece 3. It is taken: at the
   ledger, `selection.executed` is MANDATORY whenever `selection.axis` is not None. See
   `results/notes/core_p3.md` for what it cost.

Retraction is a first-class operation (§9). `withdraw(id, reason, superseded_by)` appends a new
line marking the claim withdrawn; the file is append-only, so the history of a retraction is itself
in the record, and `rows()` folds it to the current state. In a project with five retractions this
is the main feature.
