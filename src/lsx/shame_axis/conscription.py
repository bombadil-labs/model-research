"""The conscription runner (`prompts/human/CONSCRIPTION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`,
`prompts/human/conscription_v1.json`): item x arm -> final-token residual at every layer, through
the ONE asserted extraction path (spec §7), with a paired per-item contrast on top.

What this module is NOT: it does not fit a `Direction`, does not patch anything, and does not build
a `Claim`. There is no registered instrument for this design (no entry in `lsx.core.registry`) and
no patch layer, so the plumbing arms `Claim` would require (`random`, `no_patch`) have nothing to
attach to yet -- inventing an instrument on my own initiative, with no planner spec and no
adversarial review, is exactly the shortcut `docs/DELEGATION.md` exists to refuse. What IS built and
exercised here is the extraction, the paired-contrast machinery, and a real `types.Arm` demonstrating
the per-item clustering check (h49) on the one control the design does support without a model
intervention: an item compared against itself, which must read exactly at its declared null of zero.

Render -> extract -> contrast, each a plain function so the dry run and a real study call the same
code:

  1. `render_prompt`     -- item's prefix + one arm's user turn, through the model's OWN chat
                             template, `add_generation_prompt=True`. The final token of this string
                             is the read position; verified empirically (not assumed) that this
                             tokenizer's fast offsets cover every templated token including
                             `<|im_start|>assistant`, so a whole-text span does not silently drop
                             them the way a content-only span keyed on template-relative text could.
  2. `build_item_grid`    -- one base item's five arms as one `Grid` (one span, `(0, len(text))`,
                             covering the *rendered* chat text, so the final real token is always in
                             it), so it goes through `extract.build_stack` / `remote.build_remote_stack`
                             exactly as any other grid does -- no bespoke extraction path.
  3. `run_local` / `run_remote` -- one base item at a time, checkpointed to `.npz` + a sidecar
                             provenance `.json` (`docs/DELEGATION.md`: "stacks are gitignored ... write
                             a provenance file next to every .npz"). A restart skips items whose
                             checkpoint already exists, so a lost job costs one item, not the run.
  4. `paired_contrasts`   -- per item, per layer, diff-norm and cosine between every arm pair,
                             **never pooled across items** (item is the independent unit); includes
                             each arm against itself as the sanity pair.
  5. `sanity_arm`         -- wraps the self-pair (e.g. `enact` vs `enact`) in a real `types.Arm`
                             with per-item cluster labels, exercising the h49 clustering-verification
                             path this design can actually support with two demo items (k == n, the
                             no-widening branch; a design with repeated items per cluster would hit
                             `checks.cluster_evidence`, which this dry run does not have data to
                             reach -- said plainly in the results note, not hidden).
