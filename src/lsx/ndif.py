"""NDIF remote execution, directly with a key or through a credential-injecting egress proxy.

Two accommodations:
  1. With `NDIF_API_KEY` in the environment (the local machine), the key is sent as nnsight sends
     it. Without one (the cloud box), a proxy adds the `ndif-api-key` header itself, so the client
     must NOT send one (it would send an empty/None value otherwise); we strip it from every request.
  2. The proxy does not carry WebSocket upgrades, so we use nnsight's non-blocking mode: submit over
     HTTPS, poll `/response/{job_id}` until complete, then push the result into the tracer.
Usage (the trace block must be in a real source file; nnsight captures its source):
    model = LanguageModel("Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B", device_map="auto", dispatch=False)
    backend = ProxyAuthBackend(model.to_model_key())
    with model.trace(prompt, backend=backend) as tracer:
        h = model.model.layers[14].output[0][0, -1].save()
    backend.wait(tracer)     # polls until the saved values are populated
