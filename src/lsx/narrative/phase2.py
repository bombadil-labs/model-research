"""Phase 2's derivable batch (`docs/specs/phase2_v1.md` §5), through the core.

Two targets, and one correctness fix that had to land first:

* **§5.1 -- writeup claims 2b and 4c**, h41's two skip-path rows, as `readout_shift` claims
  carrying a `PassthroughArm`. A direction added at block L reaches the unembedding by the
  residual skip path whether or not any block uses it, so the quantity that means "the stack
  computed this" is `treatment - passthrough`, never the treatment alone (spec §2a).
* **§5.2 -- writeup claim 4b**, h8's battery re-fit on the cached replication stacks, each row
  reporting **gain over its own MEASURED lexical floor** rather than over chance (spec §6, and
  h47: of h8's four reference rows only era clears its floor).

The fix is `Arm.n_independent` (see `registry.InstrumentSpec.arm_tolerance`), which everything
here depends on: several of these arms have items that are not independent draws.

**What this module does NOT do: append to `results/ledger.jsonl`.** Every number below comes from
a cached `.npz` stack or a cached JSON that a frozen script in `scripts/` wrote, not from
`extract.build_stack`, so none of these claims carries a stack signature and the ledger refuses
them with `ProvenanceNotFromStack` -- the same refusal h29 hit in piece 4, which piece 5 cleared
by re-extracting. Re-extraction is not available here: four of the five replication models are not
in the local HF cache at all, and h41's residuals were never cached. The claims are therefore
*built* -- which runs the whole §4 contract, every arm against its declared null, both floors, the
calibration gate -- rendered, and written to `results/`. They are candidates for the ledger and
the note says so rather than rounding it off.
