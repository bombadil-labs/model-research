"""Piece 5: close phase 1's gate, or say which target cannot be closed.

Piece 4 ended with §1B passing 12 of 12 and §1A failing on **reporting**: every instrument existed,
every number that could be recomputed reproduced to the logged decimals, and five targets were
refused for how their batteries were run or summarised. This module re-runs those batteries.

    1. h8's three single-factor lenses -- `MissingArm('permutation')`. The arm now exists
       (`reproduce.permuted_level_directions`).
    2. h29's 3x re-imposed generation -- one arm. The three-arm battery is
       `lsx.narrative.rerun_h29`; this module grades it.
    3. h39's Gemma clock -- `discrimination` exists, the stacks do not.
    4. h16 -- reproduced by piece 4; confirmed here, with the 2.21 / 2.1692 aggregate settled.
    5. h8 composed -- gain over CHANCE where §6 requires gain over a MEASURED floor on a flagged
       grid. The floor is measured by `reproduce.h8_lexical_floor`.

Run:  .venv/bin/python -m lsx.narrative.piece5 --parts h8,h16       (local, CPU)
      .venv/bin/python -m lsx.narrative.piece5 --parts h29,h39      (grades what the remote run wrote)
