"""GOAL 2 instalment 2: a band on `gain_over_floor`.

`results/notes/painaxis_floor_nulls.md` §6 names the gap in its own words: the +0.046 gain of
the 28-block network over the static-embedding bag "is a difference of two AUCs measured on the
same sentences; its null needs a paired resample over sentence sets, which I did not run."

This runs it. Two bands, each with a stated meaning, because they answer different questions:

  (1) SPLIT BAND. Repeated K-fold over R fold seeds. Answers: how much does the published number
      move if you re-draw the arbitrary fold assignment? Says nothing about sentence sampling.

  (2) CLUSTER BOOTSTRAP BAND. Resample the sentence SETS with replacement (the sets are the
      exchangeable unit: each holds exactly one sentence per category, and the K-fold already
      splits on them). Answers: how much does it move if you re-draw the stimuli?

Leakage rule for (2), stated because it is the only thing that makes the bootstrap honest: a set
drawn twice occupies two slots, and if those slots landed in different folds the SAME sentences
would sit in train and test. So folds are assigned at the level of the set IDENTITY, before
multiplicity is applied -- every copy of a set is always on the same side of the split.

PAIRED throughout: within a replicate, the treatment layer and the embedding floor see the
identical resampled sentences and the identical folds, so the difference is a within-replicate
quantity and the shared stimulus noise cancels in it.

Reported at EVERY layer, not at the peak (CLAUDE.md non-negotiable 4). The peak row is printed
for continuity with the note, flagged as such, and is not how the layer was chosen.

Null: gain = 0 (the network buys nothing over the bag of token vectors).
