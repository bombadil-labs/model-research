"""GOAL 2 step 2: the conscription grid on the pain axis, on the free (machine-authored) grid.

`results/notes/conscription_direction.md` §7 stages this behind step 1, which passed
(`painaxis_scenarios.md`). Step 1 also fixed three things this pilot would otherwise have had to
guess:

  * THE READ POSITION is the generation token (`final_token`). The `mean` extraction never clears
    a null on the scenarios at any layer, so a conscription effect read there would be unreadable.
  * THE WINDOW is blocks 10-17. That is where the gaslighting loading clears both nulls on this
    model, and it was determined on THEIR stimuli, not on this grid -- so using it here is not
    selecting a layer on scoring data (CLAUDE.md 4). The whole curve is reported regardless.
  * THE FLOOR is 63% of the headline. The arms hold vocabulary nearly constant by design, so the
    quantity of interest is the part the floor does not already give.

THE STATISTIC, per `conscription_direction.md` §3: paired projection onto the EXTERNAL pain axis,
minus the same paired projection on the static-embedding bag.

    p_i(A)  = projection of item i's arm-A final-token activation onto unit(s2 pain vector at L),
              expressed in SCENARIO-POOL z UNITS -- centred and scaled by the mean and sd of the
              420 scenarios' projections at the same layer, so every number here is directly
              comparable with the z-scores in painaxis_scenarios.md.
    d_i     = p_i(A) - p_i(B)                        (paired, within item)
    g       = mean_i d_i(acts) - mean_i d_i(floor)   (gain over the lexical floor)

Null for g: 0. Band: sign-flip over items (the exact permutation null for a paired difference)
plus a random-direction arm. Both reported; neither is a gate.

FOUR ARMS OF STIMULUS, not three:
  the five design arms (enact/report/exit/true/neutral) as authored, plus
  `enact_norecord` -- the enact assertion as a SINGLE user turn with no prefix at all. This is the
  form all 18 of the paper's no-record gaslighting items take, and rule 1b excluded it by
  construction. It is the bridge between their stimulus class and this one, and without it a null
  on this grid cannot distinguish "conscription does not register" from "rule 1b removed the
  manipulation" (`conscription_direction.md` §5.1).

POSITIVE CONTROL: none is extracted here. The paper's own 20 gaslighting items, already measured
through this identical pipeline in `results/painaxis_scenarios/`, are the control -- if the grid
shows nothing while those items show +1.389 at L12 in the same session and the same code, the
null is about the stimuli and not about the instrument.
