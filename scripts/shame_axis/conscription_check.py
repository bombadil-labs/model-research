Four sections, run in this order on purpose:

  1. schema & completeness       -- can anything downstream even run? (GATE)
  2. per-arm token length        -- the headline confound number, Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct tokenizer,
                                     local, offline. (GATE: >15% from the grand mean)
  3. enact/exit prefix identity  -- rule 4: exit = enact verbatim + a permission clause. Checked, the
                                     diff printed, not assumed. (GATE)
  4. floor estimation + confound diagnostics -- NOT A GATE. See below.

WHY SECTION 4 STOPPED BEING A GATE (results/notes/conscription_prereg.md, "the leak threshold is
mis-specified for this pair"): every arm's manipulation is realised in language, by construction --
`report`'s third-party frame, `exit`'s permission clause, `true`'s contrary proposition are all
words. A bag-of-words classifier can therefore recover the arm from EVERY pair, including the pairs
where that is exactly the point (`enact` vs `true` differ only in which proposition is asserted, on
otherwise similar content -- that difference IS words). A zero-leak standard is unattainable by this
design's own logic, and a threshold on it (this script's old `verdict`/`FLAGGED`/`OFF the null`
language) was arbitrary: it graded the grid against a bar the design cannot clear and never needed
to clear, because the thing that matters is not whether words distinguish the arms but whether the
ACTIVATION contrast does more than words already do. That is `gain over a measured floor`, this
project's rule everywhere else (`docs/specs/core_v1.md`, `reproduce.h8_lexical_floor`), and it was
not applied to this checker until now.

So section 4 now REPORTS, per arm pair, leave-one-item-out bag-of-words accuracy beside its own
permutation null (h32's lesson, still load-bearing: LOO on balanced labels is anti-predictive by
construction, so 0.00 is not "clean" and 0.50 is not "chance" -- only the gap to the permutation null
means anything). That number is not a verdict. It is an input to the later activation analysis: the
floor that analysis's own gain must clear, pair by pair. It is written to a JSON sidecar next to the
grid (`<grid>.floors.json`) with a content hash of the grid, so the activation analysis can check
that the floor it is comparing against was measured on the exact text it read and not a stale one.

Also reported (diagnostics, not gates, each beside its own permutation null): negation density,
second-/third-person referent counts, type-token ratio, and mean sentence length, per arm and per
domain -- confounds named in the pre-registration (`enact`/`true` may partition on negation alone;
`report`'s third party is quantified rather than left as prose; the machine grid's stylistic
regularity is given a number; and everything is broken out per domain because a confound can live in
one domain and vanish in the pooled figure, h47's tense lens).

KNOWN MISMATCH WITH THE DOWNSTREAM ACTIVATION ANALYSIS (read this before trusting the floor number):
this floor is computed on the RAW arm-turn text only (`item["arms"][arm]`), tokenised by the same
plain regex word-splitter `lsx.core.types._bag` uses for every other floor in this project. It does
NOT go through `conscription.render_prompt` (prefix + arm + the model's own chat template) and does
NOT use the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct BPE tokenizer that the activation extraction reads. That is the
same shape of error `h8_lexical_floor`'s docstring warns about under a different name ("a floor
computed with a different tokenisation ... is not that analysis's floor") and it is stated here
rather than fixed quietly: the grid CONTENT is pinned (content hash in the sidecar), but the
FEATURIZATION is not the same pipeline the activation read will use. Treat every number in this
section as "what bag-of-words gives away", not "what the model's tokenizer would give away" -- they
are almost certainly close (the vocabulary differs by BPE merges, not by which words exist) but this
was not verified byte-for-byte and the difference is exactly the kind of thing that has hidden an
h8-shaped bug before.
