"""The one property that makes the cluster bootstrap honest: no set straddles a split.

A bootstrap that resamples clusters with replacement and then folds on ROW position lets the
same sentences sit in train and test, which inflates held-out AUC. The gain is a difference, so
some of that cancels -- but not all, and "it mostly cancels" is not a control. These tests pin
the leak-free construction instead of trusting it.
