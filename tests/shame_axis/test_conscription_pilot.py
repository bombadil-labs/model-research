"""The paired statistic and its sign-flip null.

A sign-flip band is the exact permutation null for a paired difference under exchangeability of
the two arms within an item. Two things have to hold or it is decoration: it must be centred on
zero whatever the data, and it must widen with the spread of the per-item differences rather than
with their mean. Both are pinned here, along with the property that makes the gain meaningful --
that the floor is subtracted WITHIN each item, so a shift shared by both arms cancels.

    Flipping signs leaves |d_i| untouched, so the null's width is set by rms(d) -- NOT by the

    WIDER band than one where items move erratically about zero. Two consequences:

      * the band cannot be read as "how much two arms differ by rewording alone". That is a
        different quantity and needs a second no-claim arm to measure (the `neutral_b` question in
        conscription_direction.md §4); the sign-flip band is not a substitute for it.
