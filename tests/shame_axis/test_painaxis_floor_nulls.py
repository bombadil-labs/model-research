"""Tests for the floor/null arms in scripts/painaxis_floor_nulls.py.

The named trap for this task is a shuffled-label null that still leaks the labels. These tests
guard the shuffle itself and the fold loop it runs through; the pipeline-level guards (my fold
loop reproducing their `kfold_curve`, and an identity permutation reproducing the treatment
curve) run inside the analysis and abort it on failure.
